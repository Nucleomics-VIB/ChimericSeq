# ChimericSeq

list of edits: 2025-03-26

* unset bowtie2 version in reqs since version has changed since the original code
* add gif picture to display in GUI (copied from the company website)
* make the config option for Trim5 active,it was ignored in the code
* stop trimming the chromosome names to clip chr away, this was a very nasty one that removed the chromosome names from my annotations

I did not evaluate (yet) the effect of other settings that might not be passe dalsthough present in teh config.txt loaded file

The app does not run yet properly in my hands and there is no active link on the company website to obtain valid test data.
